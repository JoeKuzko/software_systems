This document will indicate what values we used to test our program as well as the logic behind why we 
chose those values. Our main goal in picking these values was to test every aspect of the program to 
ensure its functionality.

The main 2 files we use for testing are:
"zipcode_row_randomized.csv"
"zipcode_column_randomized.csv"

These two files were chosen to ensure that no matter whether the columns or rows are reordered, the program
will maintain its functionality and the output is the exact same. 

The following tests were made in the following order (the same order as the scriptfile):
- Ensure both files output the same results for the functionality of Zip Code 1.0
- Ensure that both files produced the right output for the console, lengthindicatedfile, and indexfile when
entering CORRECT zip code values as parameters
- Ensure that both files produced the right output for the console, lengthindicatedfile, and indexfile when
entering INCORRECT values as well 

In the scriptfile, each test was run in the following order (after first compiling the program):
-run the program with the testing parameters
-display the index file to the console (cat command) after the program output
(the length indicated text file is too large to be displayed into the scriptfile, but will be verified)

Here are the tests entered in order (in accordance to scriptfile):
